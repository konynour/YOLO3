# YOLOv8 Object Detection with ESP32-CAM Streaming

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the **YOLOv8** model with images streamed from an ESP32-CAM. The Python script captures images from the ESP32-CAM, detects objects (e.g., cats, birds, people, and cars), and displays the annotated results. The model is trained using the **COCO dataset**, which includes 80 different classes of common objects.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 to detect and annotate objects in real-time.
- **ESP32-CAM Integration**: Streams images from an ESP32-CAM over WiFi.
- **Resolution Options**: Supports various image resolutions (low, medium, high) from the ESP32-CAM.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Utilizes a YOLOv8 model pre-trained on the **COCO dataset**, capable of detecting objects like cats, dogs, people, vehicles, and more.

## Requirements

### Python Script
- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python` (for image processing)
  - `numpy` (for handling arrays)
  - `ultralytics` (for YOLOv8 object detection)

To install the required libraries, you can run the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics














YOLOv8 Object Detection with ESP32-CAM Streaming
Overview
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model with images streamed from an ESP32-CAM. The Python script captures images from an ESP32-CAM, detects objects, and displays annotated results, including categories like people, animals, and vehicles.

Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Uses YOLOv8 to detect and annotate objects.
ESP32-CAM Integration: Streams images from the ESP32-CAM over WiFi.
Resolution Options: Supports multiple image resolutions (low, medium, high) for streaming.
Requirements
Python Script
Python 3.x
Required libraries: opencv-python, numpy, ultralytics
Install the necessary libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics
ESP32-CAM Setup
ESP32-CAM module
Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
WiFi network credentials
Ensure that you have the esp32cam and WebServer libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install the required libraries.
Setup
ESP32-CAM Code
Install the Required Libraries
Ensure that the esp32cam and WebServer libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE.

Upload the Code
Open the Arduino IDE.
Paste the ESP32-CAM code into a new sketch.
Upload the code to your ESP32-CAM.
Connect to WiFi
Replace the WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS in the ESP32-CAM code with your WiFi credentials.

Obtain the IP Address
After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the ESP32-CAMâ€™s IP address. You will use this IP to access the camera stream.

Python Script
Configure the URL
In the Python script, replace the url variable with the IP address of your ESP32-CAM, followed by the image path (e.g., http://<ESP32-IP>/cam-hi.jpg).

Run the Script
To start capturing and processing images from the ESP32-CAM, navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

bash
Copy code
python script.py
View the Output
The script will open a window displaying the image with detected objects. Press the 'q' key to close the window and stop the stream.

Object Detection Classes
The YOLOv8 model is pre-trained on the COCO Dataset, which includes 80 object classes. Examples of detectable objects include:

People: Humans in various poses and situations.
Animals: Cats, dogs, birds, etc.
Vehicles: Cars, buses, trucks, bicycles, and motorcycles.
Everyday Objects: Chairs, cups, books, bottles, and more.
For a full list of object classes, refer to the official COCO dataset documentation.

Code Overview
Python Script
Model Initialization: Loads the YOLOv8 model for object detection using the ultralytics library.
Image Handling: Fetches images from the ESP32-CAM URL using OpenCV.
Object Detection: Processes images using YOLOv8 to detect and annotate objects.
Display: Displays the annotated images in a window that can be closed by pressing the 'q' key.
ESP32-CAM Code
Camera Setup: Initializes the ESP32-CAM with different resolutions (low, medium, high).
Web Server: Configures a web server to stream JPEG images at various resolutions.
Endpoint Handlers: Handles requests for different resolutions (e.g., cam-hi.jpg for high resolution, cam-lo.jpg for low resolution).
